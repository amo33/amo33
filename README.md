<p>
   <p>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on AI compiler and ML models.</p>
   <p>ðŸŒ± I learned django and machine learning to become a ML Engineer.</p>
   <p>ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on lots of ML Projects. In my perspective, I want to study mlops and data engineering . This is because I want to be an engineer who can deploy ai service with good performance and with good development discipline .</p>
   <p>ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building my own strength in backend. Plus, trying to deploy ai service myself starting from bottom. As I'd experienced intern, I started studying what is good code.</p>
   <p>ðŸ”­ I have developed mlops since April. I'm currently using k8s(kubeadm),jenkins, docker in my environment.</p>
   <p>ðŸ“« How to reach me: email me to andy700@naver.com :) ...</p>
   
   <p>âš¡ Fun fact: I am now studying ML parts in google bootcamp. Logical thinking helps me to search and study much more!</p>
   <p> TMI : I'm Sophister undergraduate student. I've been studying artificial intelligence by myself. </p>
