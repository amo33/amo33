   <p>ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on object detection and recommendation system.</p>
   <p>ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning django and machine learning.</p>
   <p>ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on lots of ML Projects. In my perspective, I want to study mlops and data engineering . This is because I want to be an engineer who can deploy ai service with good perfomance.</p>
   <p>ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with building my own strength in backend. Plus, trying to deploy ai service myself starting from bottom. As I'd experienced intern, I started study about good codes, and efficient codes. Plus cloud services, docker felt very attracting techs to use.</p>

   <p>âš¡ Fun fact: I am now studying ML parts in google bootcamp. Everyday studying is not boring. Logical thinking helps me to search and study much more!</p>
   <p> TMI : I'm Sophister undergraduate student. I've been studying artificial intelligence by myself. </p>
   <p> And I'm planning to work in IT company instead of joining the army. I hope I enhnace my algorithm and backend (plus ML) skils sooner! </p>
